4.5 degree typing angle

F12 WKL TKL

~16.6mm front height (adjusted without bumpons) 

1.5mm internal brass sheet 

top (Jane v2) and oring mountings

h87c PCB by Hiney in both north and south faching spacebar wire should be compatible with this keyboard - other pcbs that have same footprint should work as well 

M3 counter sunk screws are used for case and weight, M2.5 for mountings
