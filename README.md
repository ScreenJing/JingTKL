My take on classic tkl with 4.5 degree typing angle and ~16.6mm front height. All versions are compatible with GEONWORKS' tadpoles.

4.5 degree typing angle

F12 WKL TKL

1.5mm internal brass sheet 

Mounting: top (Jane v2) in both screws and tadpole / gummy worm oring

h87c PCB by Hiney in both north and south faching spacebar wire should be compatible with this keyboard - other pcbs that have same footprint should work as well 

M3 counter sunk screws are used for case and weight, M2.5 for mountings
